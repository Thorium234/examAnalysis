# Friends Kikai Boys High School - Examination Management System

## Project Overview
This is a Django-based examination analysis system similar to Zeraki, designed specifically for Friends Kikai Boys High School in Kenya. The system automates examination analysis, student performance tracking, and generates comprehensive reports using the Chinese technique of merit ranking.

- **Database**: SQLite (for testing/development)
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 4 with responsive design
- **PDF Generation**: ReportLab (for future implementation)
- **Authentication**: Custom User model with role-based permissions

## User Roles & Permissions
1. **Super User**: Full system access
2. **Principal**: School-wide oversight and reports
3. **Deputy Principal**: Administrative functions
4. **Director of Studies (DOS)**: Academic oversight and analysis
5. **Teachers**: Class-specific and subject-specific access

## Getting Started
1. Login credentials for testing:
   - **Admin**: username: `admin`, password: `admin123`
   - **Teacher**: username: `amira_amara`, password: `password123`
   - **Principal**: username: `principal`, password: `password123`

2. Access the admin panel at `/admin/` for data management
3. Use the main dashboard for examination analysis
4. Merit lists can be accessed from exam details or dashboard

## Technical Notes
- Django server runs on port 5000
- Database is automatically migrated on startup
- Rankings are calculated using `python manage.py calculate_rankings`
- Sample data can be regenerated with `python manage.py populate_sample_data`

This system successfully automates the manual examination analysis processes previously done at the school, providing professional-grade functionality similar to commercial systems like Zeraki.
