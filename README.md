# Friends Kikai Boys High School - Examination Management System

## Project Overview
This is a Django-based examination analysis system similar to Zeraki, designed specifically for Friends Kikai Boys High School in Kenya. The system automates examination analysis, student performance tracking, and generates comprehensive reports using the Chinese technique of merit ranking.

## Architecture & Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Django 5.2.6 with Python 3.11
- **Database**: SQLite (for testing/development)
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 4 with responsive design
- **PDF Generation**: ReportLab (for future implementation)
- **Authentication**: Custom User model with role-based permissions

## User Roles & Permissions
1. **Super User**: Full system access
2. **Principal**: School-wide oversight and reports
3. **Deputy Principal**: Administrative functions
4. **Director of Studies (DOS)**: Academic oversight and analysis
5. **Teachers**: Class-specific and subject-specific access

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Student Management System

- Student management system
- Exam creation and result entry
- Automated grade and ranking calculation
- Merit list generation with filtering
- Basic dashboard and navigation
- Admin interface configuration

- Advanced teacher dashboards
- Role-based permission enforcement in views

ðŸ“‹ **Future Enhancements:**
- Email notifications for results
- Mobile-responsive result entry
- Advanced analytics and charts
- SMS integration for parent notifications
- Bulk data import/export functionality

## Getting Started
1. Login credentials for testing:
   - **Admin**: username: `admin`, password: `admin123`
   - **Teacher**: username: `amira_amara`, password: `password123`
   - **Principal**: username: `principal`, password: `password123`

2. Access the admin panel at `/admin/` for data management
3. Use the main dashboard for examination analysis
4. Merit lists can be accessed from exam details or dashboard

## Technical Notes
- Django server runs on port 5000
- Database is automatically migrated on startup
- Rankings are calculated using `python manage.py calculate_rankings`
- Sample data can be regenerated with `python manage.py populate_sample_data`

This system successfully automates the manual examination analysis processes previously done at the school, providing professional-grade functionality similar to commercial systems like Zeraki.


Django Project Architecture BreakdownThis project is a great example of how to build a scalable, multi-tenant application using Django's app-based architecture. The core idea is that each functional part of the system is its own self-contained module (an "app").The Core Concept: Multi-TenancyThe central principle of this entire project is multi-tenancy. This means the system is designed to serve multiple schools from a single codebase and database, without letting the data from one school mix with another.The way this is achieved is by having a School model that acts as the primary key for all other data. Let's look at the key models:CustomUser: Every user, whether a teacher, student, or admin, is linked to a School via a ForeignKey relationship.Student: A student record belongs to a specific School via a ForeignKey.Subject: A subject is also linked to a School.This design ensures that when a user logs in, the application can filter all data based on their associated school, providing a secure and separate experience for each institution.How the Apps are Wired Together (The "Wiring")The apps you listed are not just separate folders; they are interconnected in a specific way to form a cohesive application. This "wiring" happens on three main levels:1. Database RelationshipsThis is the most critical connection point. As mentioned above, the school app is the central hub. Other apps like accounts, students, and subjects are wired to it through ForeignKey relationships.For example, a student is created in the students app, but its record includes a field that points directly to a school in the school app. This is the primary way the apps "talk" to each other at the data level.2. Views and Access ControlThe views in each app are designed to enforce the multi-tenancy logic. A common pattern seen in the code is filtering data based on the logged-in user's school.For instance, in the StudentListView, the get_queryset method is defined as:def get_queryset(self):
    return Student.objects.filter(school=self.request.user.school)
This is a powerful and efficient way to ensure that a teacher or admin from "School A" can only view students from "School A," even though all student records might be in the same database table. This is the separation of logic in practice.3. URL Routing and NavigationThe urls.py file serves as the navigation map for the entire application. It routes requests to the correct views in the appropriate app. For example, path('students/', views.student_list, name='student_list') directs a user to the student_list view within the school app.The front-end, using {% url '...' %} tags in HTML, is also wired this way. When a user clicks a link like <a href="{% url 'school:teacher_list' %}">Teachers</a>, the application knows exactly which view to call and which app it belongs to.Separation of Logic and RedundancyYou're right to notice the separation of logic. This is a core tenet of good software design. Each app handles its own distinct responsibilities:accounts: User creation, roles, and profiles.students: Student information, enrollment, and advancement.exams: Exam definitions and result management.reports: Placeholder for generating analytical reports.This separation makes the codebase easier to manage, test, and expand. For example, if you wanted to change how student advancement works, you would primarily work within the students app without affecting the exam logic.While the separation is effective, there's a subtle form of redundancy that can be addressed in a larger project. In your views.py files, you have multiple list and create views for different models. While using Django's Class-Based Views like ListView and CreateView is a great start, a more advanced refactoring might involve creating a custom mixin to automatically handle the school filtering for all views.The Role of "Streams"In this project, "streams" are simply a way to further organize students within a school. The Student model has a stream field, likely a CharField, to hold this information. This is a simple data point that can be used to filter or group students on the front-end (e.g., "All students in Form 2, Stream 1"). The "streams" themselves don't appear to be a separate model, which keeps the database design simple and lightweight.
