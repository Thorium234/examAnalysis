  - Reassign user roles (e.g., change from Teacher to Principal)
  - Assign/modify class assignments
  - Update subject responsibilities
  - Manage permissions based on role

#### User Interface
- Clean, card-based design with visual role indicators
- Search and filter functionality for finding specific users
- Quick access to role modification interface
- Confirmation dialogs for critical role changes

#### Permissions
- Only administrators should have access to modify user roles

update on our base.html and school dashboard so that they allign with our new updates  like on the base.html add  dashboards on our students so that it handles  /students/form/1/ > /students/form/1/stream/west/ as we had discussed  also update  forms & classes card also so that when i go to form i get on top card for streams and below we have a combined list having the details and the specific stream then when i clcick on streams like North i should get north students and i should be able to add remember we said saul kitui is the principal  then from this url http://127.0.0.1:8000/school/forms/  it should show me the card of strems which i will be able to navigate into specific stream and below it we have a combined list of students

ensure that we have 5 students in each stream like form 1 west 5,east 5,north 5 south 5 then now in the whole form 1 we have a combined list of 2o students do it accross the forms

Using the URLconf defined in exam_system.urls, Django tried these URL patterns, in this order:

    admin/
    [name='root']
    login-selection/ [name='login_selection']
    accounts/
    students/ [name='student_list']
    students/ form/<int:form_level>/ [name='form_dashboard']
    students/ form/<int:form_level>/stream/<str:stream>/ [name='stream_students']
    students/ create/ [name='student_create']
    students/ <int:pk>/ [name='student_detail']
    students/ <int:pk>/update/ [name='update_student']
    students/ <int:pk>/delete/ [name='delete_student']
    students/ <int:pk>/enroll/ [name='enroll_student']

The current path, students/187/enroll/, matched the last one.

Youâ€™re seeing this error because you have DEBUG = True in your Django settings file. Change that to False, and Django will display a standard 404 page.
