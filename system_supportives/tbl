i want this table to be like this 
AdmissionNo,Name,Stream,Mathematics,Biology,Physics,Geography,CRE,BusinessStudies,totalMark,meanMarks,NoOfSubjects,averageMark
Grade,totalpoints,Deviation,StreamPosition,ClassPosition
4405,Brarly Kimatia,East,37.00,69.00,79.00,42.00,64.00,42.00

and this headers should be in short form like CRE for Christian Religious Education
and     BST for Business Studies
and     COMP for computer Studies
and  CHEM for Chemistry
and     PHY for Physics
and     BIO for Biology
and     MATH for Mathematics
and     GEO for Geography
and     ENG for English
and     KIS for Kiswahili
and     HIST for History
and     AGRI for Agriculture
and     TOMA for totalMark
and     MEMA for meanMarks
and     NSBJ for NoOfSubjects
and     AVERAGE MARK for averageMark
and     GRADE for Grade
and     TOPO for totalpoints
and     DEVI for Deviation
and     STPOS for StreamPosition
and     CLPOS for ClassPosition
and the marks should be added in their respective subjects columns
and the total mark should be added and the mean marks should be calculated and the number of subjects should be calculated
and the average mark should be calculated
and the grade should be calculated based on the mean marks
and the total points should be calculated based on the grade
and the deviation should be calculated based on the mean marks
and the stream position should be calculated based on the mean marks
and the class position should be calculated based on the mean marks
and the table should be sorted based on the stream position
and the table should be filterable based on the stream
and the table should be filterable based on the class
and the table should be filterable based on the subject
and the table should be filterable based on the grade
and the table should be filterable based on the total marks
and the table should be filterable based on the mean marks
and the table should be filterable based on the number of subjects
and the table should be filterable based on the average marks
and the table should be filterable based on the total points
and the table should be filterable based on the deviation
and the table should be filterable based on the stream position
and the table should be filterable based on the class position
and the table should be exportable to excel
and the table should be exportable to pdf
and the table should be exportable to csv
