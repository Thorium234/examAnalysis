Yes, **major redundancies**:

1. **Duplicate dashboard views** - `school_dashboard.html` AND `forms_dashboard.html` doing the same thing

2. **Multiple student list templates**:
   - `students_list.html` 
   - `student_list.html` (in both students/ and school/)
   - Likely showing same data

3. **Duplicate stream student views**:
   - `stream_students.html` (in students/)
   - `stream_students.html` (in school/)

4. **Multiple report card templates**:
   - `report_card.html` (students/)
   - `student_report_card.html` (school/)
   - `student_report_card.html` (reports/)
   - `pdf_template_report_card.html` (reports/)

5. **Student detail redundancy**:
   - `student_detail.html`
   - `student_subjects.html`
   - Likely overlapping info

6. **Dashboard overload**:
   - `admin_dashboard.html`
   - `teacher_dashboard.html`
   - `student_dashboard.html`
   - `school_dashboard.html`
   - `department_dashboard.html`
   - `stream_dashboard.html`
   - `subject_dashboard.html`
   - `school_wide_dashboard.html`

**Recommendation**: Consolidate into ONE main dashboard with role-based sections, ONE student list, ONE report card system.
