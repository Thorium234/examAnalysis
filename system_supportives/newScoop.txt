i want you to study this instructions carefully becouse you are my programmer still on our system we want to advance this are my apps 'accounts',

    'students',

    'exams',

    'reports',
    school
    'subjects', wich i have created and i have wired them and i want us to wire automatically so based on your experince you will tell me which files from which app do you need 
we are advancing the system 
the students are sorted groupwise in our system but now i want us to sort them now groupwise so one we shold have class_dashboard.html for the student of all forms like form2 students only
2. we should have stream_dashbord.html which has students from specific streams only like form2 but only students from west are available there alone not the student from north

on top of each dashboard we have mentioned we should have the cards for subjects availbale and if any exam is done the top students in each subject when you click on the subject card it should take you to the that particular subject information containing form for marks entry and also list of students name,admission number,marks for the very subject 
3. with the explanation above now we should have subject dashboard for the specific stream and subject dashboard for every form which will be like in form subject dashboard has all the stents in the very form like form2 students also you can use to enter marks 

now back to our class/stream dashboard on top we have cards but below it we have list of stdents having name,admin,kcse,marks in each subject listed horizontally with subjects name as labelled accordingly  totals avarage points,total marks,rank etc 

NB: the other dashboard for the very stream and forms are analysis dashboard wich contains all graphs visual performance of the classes top students  trend in performance and also the reportscan be generated also each student has his own dashboard so that we can be abel to trace perfomance and report ananlysis for the very student. the student can be able gto see the  well perfomed subject and graphs for the trends then pdf can be generated for each analysis and also the lists can be printed into sheet od paper A4 papers and we are not just converting the HTM tags to pdf we are looking for the3 specific information class list stricktly strudent information captured and also for exam result for specific subject or for the stream or form we should just export the table well vanished table titles and labels and thre data i  the table  not just scripting the html into a pdf not we are making a prophessionaly staff here


so when we enter astudent details like paul form2 west he goes to form2 dashboard that is general then he will be also found in a stream dashboard which is west

The exam dashboards as we have said here is the new scope of it one can downmload an excel free template and enters marks for students and upload back for anaylysis and  infact even students detals can be aploaded by csv or excel and then the data either for students or exam results can be exported either to word or excel also at subject level we should add same functionality you can add missing student in the subject or class where you will be able to search for the availability of the student i  the stream or form or even at school level 


4:Another crucial issue is here when a student has choosen 8 subjects but we are grading only 7 we should choose best perfomed 2 sciences eg if chemistry is 50%,Biology 79% and Physcs 10% we shoul exclude physiscs as we do avarage and also total marks the system does that automatically 

5: We should have entire shcool dashboard showing the top stream and form the top subject in the in each stream  form and also school the most imporoved subject graphs and other analysis features should be available 

6:department_dashbord.html which has the subjects for the very department and there analysis and it should be streamwise,formwise and schoolwise showing top subject in the department

7:Graduate student dashboard with this dashboard wich is available in each stream and ech form where we can click on a student of form3 west and we can move that student to form3 south or form form1 to form2 meaning we can move individual student or a group or a entire class 
NB this will be aplicable in a situation where a perticular student drops a subject and decides to do another subject on the way 

8: lets have a watermark with a school logo in everything meaning we show that the stend is is having valid pdf form a school 

9:the result list should be able  to sort the student in an order that is from the top student to the last one

10: subject champions dashboard having winners of the subjects in each stream and each form then comhbined entire school

11: we should have form subject dashboard having subjects details and  also we can demote those that are not done
12:we should have stream subject dashboard also having subjects to be done by the very stream and we can either select it or delesect meaning that if form2 west if we delect business and agriculture we will remain with students only doing the very subject or even we can just leave it becouse we have another dashboard specifically for students
13: students_subjects_dashboard where buy default everystent does each subject we can just either desect so that it wont  be availabe on the students report.

exam dashboard html for each stream and form so that when you click  on it in the classDashboard you can see the number of exams they have done listed on the dashboard then from there you can be able to view the resut for the particular exam then you can generate pdfs for all studentd which is in an A4 paper size 

you can also click on an individual student and click generate button for the result

main dahboard will be simple and prophesional have cards to go tospecific location eg analysis for the whole school,form,stream

it will be in variuos sections of cards where you click on forms it shpuld take you to forms eg 1,2,3,4 when you click on form4 you will see streams eg east,west,south,north  cards and also exams dashboard for form4 as whole the nwhen you click on exam dashboard you will see exams done by this students and you will be able to navigate into it back to  form you will see the studentsform combined stream of 4E,4S etc when you want to generate report you click on exam you have done so that you can view tha analysis of the very exam click analyze
