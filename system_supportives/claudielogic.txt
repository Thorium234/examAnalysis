Simple Explanation of the Class Management Form
What We're Building
We're creating a form page where a school administrator can add a new class to the system. Think of it like filling out a detailed registration form, but instead of registering a person, we're registering a class and telling the system what subjects that class will study.

The Page Layout (What You See)
Top Section - The Header

Left side: The school logo "ZERAKI ANALYTICS" in blue
Middle: The school name "Friends Kikai Boys High School" in green
Right side:

A language selector showing "English"
A notification bell icon (with a red dot if there are new notifications)
A message/email icon
The logged-in teacher's name and profile picture



Navigation Bar (Green Bar)
Just below the header, there's a green horizontal bar with three buttons:

"My Classes" - to view your classes
"Manage Classes" - to see all classes
"Add New Class" - this one is highlighted/active (the page we're on)

Main Form Area (White Background)
This is where the actual form lives. It has several sections:
Section 1: Basic Information (Top of Form)
Two boxes side by side:
Left Box - "Form" (with a red star meaning required)

A dropdown menu where you select which form level: Form 1, Form 2, Form 3, or Form 4
It shows "Select Form" when nothing is chosen
Has a light gray background

Right Box - "Stream(s)" (with a small blue info icon)

A text box showing selected streams like "North, South, East"
Below it, clickable checkboxes for different streams (North, South, East, West, etc.)
You can select multiple streams by ticking the boxes

Section 2: Subject Selection (Main Area)
A big heading says: "Select Subjects done by this class"
Below this, the subjects are organized into 7 columns (like a grid), each with its own category:
Column 1 - Mathematics

Just one checkbox: Mathematics

Column 2 - Languages

English
Kiswahili
Kenyan Sign Language

Each subject has a checkbox next to it. The checkboxes are empty squares that turn green with a checkmark when clicked.
Section 3: Submit Button (Bottom Right)
A green button that says "✓ Add"

Clicking this saves the class with all selected subjects
The checkmark symbol shows it's a positive action

Bottom Section - Footer
At the very bottom, centered:

Gray text saying "© 2025 Zeraki. All Rights Reserved."
"Zeraki" is a clickable blue link


How It Works (The Logic)
Step 1: Selecting Form Level
The administrator clicks the "Form" dropdown and chooses which grade level (Form 1, 2, 3, or 4) this class belongs to.
Step 2: Selecting Streams
The administrator ticks one or more stream checkboxes. As they tick boxes, the names appear in the text box above (like "North, South, East"). This helps them see what they've selected.
Step 3: Selecting Subjects
The administrator goes through all seven columns and ticks checkboxes for every subject this class will study. For example:

A science class might tick: Mathematics, English, Kiswahili, Biology, Physics, Chemistry
An arts class might tick: Mathematics, English, Kiswahili, History, Geography, Business Studies

Step 4: Validation (Error Checking)
When the administrator clicks the green "Add" button, the system checks:

Is a form level selected? If not, show an error: "Please select a form level"
Is at least one stream selected? If not, show an error: "Please select at least one stream"
Is at least one subject selected? If not, show an error: "Please select at least one subject"

Step 5: Saving
If everything is filled correctly, the system:

Saves the new class information
Links it to the selected streams
Links it to all the selected subjects
Shows a success message: "Class added successfully!"
Takes the administrator to the "Manage Classes" page


Visual Design Details
Colors Used

Green (#4CAF50): Main action color - used for navigation bar, submit button, category titles
Blue (#2196F3): Used for logo, links, info icons
White: Background for main content area
Light Gray (#f5f5f5): Page background
Very Light Gray (#fafafa): Background for subject category boxes
Red (#f44336): Required field indicator, notification dot

Spacing and Layout

Everything has comfortable spacing - not cramped
The subject columns are equal width
Each subject box has rounded corners (soft, friendly look)
Checkboxes are large enough to click easily (18px × 18px)
When you hover over a subject, its background turns very light green to show it's clickable

Interactive Elements

Hover effects: When you move your mouse over a subject name, the background changes slightly
Active states: The "Add New Class" tab in the green navigation bar looks different (slightly lighter) to show you're on that page
Checkbox animations: When clicked, checkboxes smoothly show a green checkmark


Data Storage (What Happens Behind the Scenes)
Four Types of Information Stored

Forms: A simple list of form levels (Form 1, Form 2, Form 3, Form 4)
Streams: A list of all available streams (North, South, East, West, etc.)
Subjects: A comprehensive list of all 100+ subjects, each tagged with its category (Mathematics, Languages, Sciences, etc.)
Classes: When a class is created, the system stores:

Which form level it belongs to
Which streams are included
Which subjects will be taught
When it was created



Relationships

One class can have multiple streams (e.g., Form 3 East and West combined)
One class can have multiple subjects (typically 8-12 subjects)
Subjects are pre-loaded in the system and never change
The administrator just selects from existing options


Mobile-Friendly Design
On smaller screens (phones and tablets):

The two-column layout at the top becomes one column
The seven subject columns become fewer columns (4 on tablets, 2 on phones, 1 on small phones)
Everything stays readable and clickable
The header items stack or shrink appropriately


Summary for Non-Programmers
What this page does: It's like a digital registration form where you create a new class by:

Choosing what grade level (Form 1-4)
Choosing which stream(s) (North, East, etc.)
Selecting all the subjects from a checklist

Why it's designed this way:

The categories make it easy to find subjects quickly
Checkboxes let you select multiple items easily
The green color matches the school's theme
Everything is clearly labeled so you know what to do
The layout is clean and not overwhelming despite having 100+ subjects

What makes it user-friendly:

Clear labels and instructions
Required fields are marked with a red star
Visual feedback when you hover or select items
Error messages if you forget something
Success message when you complete it correctly
You can see your stream selections updating in real-time



Here is the example

Django Form Creation Instructions for Agentic Model
Project Overview
Create a Class Management Form for Friends Kikai Boys High School that allows administrators to add new classes by selecting subjects across multiple categories.
Backend Implementation (Django)
1. Database Models Required
Models to create:
python# models.py

class Form(models.Model):
    """Represents school forms (Form 1, Form 2, etc.)"""
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)  # e.g., "Form 1", "Form 2"
    
class Stream(models.Model):
    """Represents class streams"""
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)  # e.g., "North", "South", "East", "West"
    
class Subject(models.Model):
    """All available subjects in the school"""
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    category = models.CharField(max_length=50, choices=[
        ('mathematics', 'Mathematics'),
        ('languages', 'Languages'),
        ('sciences', 'Sciences'),
        ('humanities', 'Humanities'),
        ('technicals', 'Technicals'),
        ('optionals', 'Optionals'),
        ('islamiyat', 'Islamiyat'),
    ])
    
class Class(models.Model):
    """Represents a class with its subjects"""
    form = models.ForeignKey(Form, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    streams = models.ManyToManyField(Stream)
    subjects = models.ManyToManyField(Subject)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
2. Django Form Structure
Create a ModelForm:
python# forms.py

from django import forms
from .models import Class, Subject, Form, Stream

class ClassCreationForm(forms.ModelForm):
    form = forms.ModelChoiceField(
        queryset=Form.objects.all(),
        required=True,
        widget=forms.Select(attrs={
            'class': 'form-select',
            'placeholder': 'Select Form'
        })
    )
    
    streams = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(
        queryset=Stream.objects.all(),
        required=True,
        widget=forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple(attrs={
            'class': 'stream-checkbox'
        })
    )
    
    # Group subjects by category
    mathematics_subjects = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(
        queryset=Subject.objects.filter(category='mathematics'),
        required=False,
        widget=forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple()
    )
    
    languages_subjects = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(
        queryset=Subject.objects.filter(category='languages'),
        required=False,
        widget=forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple()
    )
    
    sciences_subjects = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(
        queryset=Subject.objects.filter(category='sciences'),
        required=False,
        widget=forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple()
    )
    
    humanities_subjects = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(
        queryset=Subject.objects.filter(category='humanities'),
        required=False,
        widget=forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple()
    )
    
    technicals_subjects = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(
        queryset=Subject.objects.filter(category='technicals'),
        required=False,
        widget=forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple()
    )
    
    optionals_subjects = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(
        queryset=Subject.objects.filter(category='optionals'),
        required=False,
        widget=forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple()
    )
    
    islamiyat_subjects = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(
        queryset=Subject.objects.filter(category='islamiyat'),
        required=False,
        widget=forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple()
    )
    
    class Meta:
        model = Class
        fields = ['form', 'streams']
    
    def save(self, commit=True):
        instance = super().save(commit=False)
        if commit:
            instance.save()
            # Collect all selected subjects from all categories
            all_subjects = []
            for field_name in self.fields:
                if field_name.endswith('_subjects'):
                    all_subjects.extend(self.cleaned_data.get(field_name, []))
            
            instance.subjects.set(all_subjects)
            instance.streams.set(self.cleaned_data['streams'])
        return instance
3. Views Implementation
Create the view:
python# views.py

from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from django.contrib import messages
from .forms import ClassCreationForm

def add_class(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = ClassCreationForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            messages.success(request, 'Class added successfully!')
            return redirect('manage_classes')
    else:
        form = ClassCreationForm()
    
    return render(request, 'add_class.html', {'form': form})
Frontend Implementation (HTML + CSS)
4. HTML Template Structure
Create the template:
html<!-- templates/add_class.html -->

{% load static %}

6. JavaScript Enhancement
Add interactivity:
javascript// static/js/add_class.js

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    // Update stream input display when checkboxes change
    const streamCheckboxes = document.querySelectorAll('.stream-checkboxes input[type="checkbox"]');
    const streamInput = document.querySelector('.stream-input');
    
    function updateStreamDisplay() {
        const selectedStreams = Array.from(streamCheckboxes)
            .filter(cb => cb.checked)
            .map(cb => cb.nextElementSibling.textContent.trim());
        
        streamInput.value = selectedStreams.join(', ') || 'Select streams';
    }
    
    streamCheckboxes.forEach(checkbox => {
        checkbox.addEventListener('change', updateStreamDisplay);
    });
    
    // Form validation
    const form = document.getElementById('classForm');
    form.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
        const formSelect = document.querySelector('#id_form');
        const anyStreamChecked = Array.from(streamCheckboxes).some(cb => cb.checked);
        const anySubjectChecked = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.subject-list input[type="checkbox"]'))
            .some(cb => cb.checked);
        
        if (!formSelect.value) {
            e.preventDefault();
            alert('Please select a form level');
            return;
        }
        
        if (!anyStreamChecked) {
            e.preventDefault();
            alert('Please select at least one stream');
            return;
        }
        
        if (!anySubjectChecked) {
            e.preventDefault();
            alert('Please select at least one subject');
            return;
        }
    });
});

Report logic for everystudent

Student Academic Report Card - Plain English Explanation
Let me walk you through what's on this academic report card, using Tobias Juma's report as an example (the first student in your document).

HEADER SECTION (Top of Page)
At the very top, you see:

School Name: Friends Kikai Boys High School
School Address: P.O BOX 345 CHWELE
Contact Information: Phone number (0710702705) and email (kikaiboys@gmail.com)
Report Title: "ACADEMIC REPORT FORM - FORM 2 - AVERAGE EXAM - (2025 TERM 2)"

Then the student's basic information:

Student Name: Tobias Juma
Admission Number: 4467 (like a student ID)
Class: Form 2 West (Grade 10, West stream)


VISUAL CHART (Bar Graph)
There's a bar chart showing how the student performed compared to the class average in each subject. It has:

Blue/dark bars: The student's scores
Gray/light bars: The class average scores
Subjects listed: ENG (English), KIS (Kiswahili), MAT (Mathematics), BIO (Biology), CHE (Chemistry), GEO (Geography), CRE (Christian Religious Education), AGR (Agriculture)
Scale: Goes from 0 to 75 on the vertical axis

This visual helps parents quickly see which subjects the student is doing well in and which ones need improvement compared to classmates.

SUMMARY BOX (Overall Performance)
A box on the right side shows the "big picture" numbers:

Mean Grade: D - This is the overall average grade for all subjects combined
Total Marks: 214/700 - The student scored 214 marks out of a possible 700 marks across all subjects
Total Points: 20/84 - In the Kenyan grading system, each grade gets points (A=12, B=10, etc.). This student earned 20 points out of a possible 84
Stream Position: 1/56 - This student is ranked 1st out of 56 students in their West stream (they're the top student in their class!)
Overall Position: 3/103 - Out of all 103 students in Form 2 (both East and West streams), this student is ranked 3rd


DETAILED SUBJECT TABLE
This is the main table showing performance in each subject. Here's what each column means:
Column Headers:

SUBJECT: The name of the subject
MID YEAR EXAM: Score from the mid-year exam (shown as a percentage)
END TERM: Score from the end-of-term exam (shown as a percentage)
AVERAGE EXAM: The average of the two exams above
RANK: How the student ranked in that specific subject among classmates
COMMENT: Teacher's feedback phrase
TEACHER: Name of the subject teacher

Additional Columns (in the average section):

MARKS: The actual percentage score
DEV.: Deviation - shows how far above (+) or below (-) the class average the student scored
GR.: Grade letter (A, B, C, D, E, or X for absent)

Example Row (English):

Mid Year Exam: 34%
End Term: 28%
Average: 31%
Deviation: -23 (meaning the student scored 23 points below the class average)
Grade: D
Rank: 3/34 (3rd out of 34 students who took English)
Comment: "Put more effort"
Teacher: Amira Amara


SUBJECTS BREAKDOWN FOR TOBIAS JUMA
Let me explain what each subject line tells us:

English (31%) - Grade D, ranked 3rd. Scored 23 points below class average. Teacher says: "Put more effort"
Kiswahili (52%) - Grade C, ranked 1st (top of the class!). Scored 23 points below average (but still got 1st place). Teacher says: "Wastani" (means "Average" in Swahili)
Mathematics (20%) - Grade D, ranked 1st. Far below average (-49 points). Teacher says: "Put more effort"
Biology (22%) - Grade D, ranked 1st. Below average (-33). Teacher says: "Put more effort"
Chemistry (9%) - Grade E, ranked 2nd. Very low, 46 points below average. Teacher says: "Weak but has potential"
Geography (25%) - Grade E, ranked 1st. Below average (-36). Teacher says: "Weak but has potential"
C.R.E. (25%) - Grade E, ranked 4th. Below average (-44). Teacher says: "Weak but has potential"
Agriculture (39%) - Grade D, ranked 1st. Actually above average (+12)! Teacher says: "Put more effort"


LINE GRAPH (Performance Over Time)
Below the table, there's a line graph titled "Tobias Juma's Performance over Time" showing:

Horizontal axis: Different exam periods (F1 T1, 2024 / F1 T2, 2024 / F1 T3, 2024 / F2 T2, 2025)

F1 = Form 1 (Grade 9)
F2 = Form 2 (Grade 10)
T1, T2, T3 = Term 1, 2, 3


Vertical axis: Score from 0 to 100

This shows whether the student's performance is improving, declining, or staying steady over time.

TEACHER'S REMARKS SECTION
A box with:

Teacher's Name and Role: "Amira Amara - Class Teacher"
Written Comment: "Below average performance. You have the potential to do better."
Signature line: For the teacher to sign
Parent's Signature line: For parents to sign acknowledging they've seen the report


SCHOOL DATES BOX
Important dates:

Closing Date: 18/09/2025 (when school closes for holiday)
Opening Date: 19/09/2025 (when school reopens - note: this seems like an error, likely should be a later date)


QR CODE & ONLINE ACCESS (Bottom)
At the very bottom:

QR Code: Parents can scan this with their phone
Instructions: "Scan to access your interactive student profile on Zeraki Analytics"
Login Username: 4467@kikaiboys (admission number + school domain)
Verification Code: Q48TFR (password to access online)

This allows parents to view more detailed analysis, trends, and interactive reports online through the Zeraki Analytics platform.

KEY OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THIS REPORT
What makes this report useful:

Multiple data points: You see two exam scores and an average, not just one test
Comparison: The deviation numbers show if the student is above or below classmates
Rankings: Parents know exactly where their child stands
Visual elements: Charts make it easy to spot strengths and weaknesses at a glance
Teacher feedback: Personal comments on each subject
Historical trends: The line graph shows if performance is improving over time
Digital access: Parents can go online for more details

What this report tells us about Tobias Juma:

He's a top performer in his class (1st in stream, 3rd overall)
Despite being top-ranked, his actual scores are low (most subjects below 40%)
This suggests the whole class is struggling - being 1st doesn't mean doing well, it means doing less poorly than others
He's strongest in Kiswahili and Agriculture
He's weakest in Chemistry, Geography, and C.R.E. (all grade E)
Teachers believe he has potential but needs to work harder


This same format repeats for every student in your document, with each student getting their own personalized page showing their unique performance, rankings, and teacher comments.

Merit List Report - Complete Technical Specification for Django Implementation
I need you to build a Merit List system that displays student exam performance in a ranked table format. Let me explain every single detail of what this report contains and how it should work.

1. WHAT IS A MERIT LIST?
A Merit List is a ranked spreadsheet-style report showing ALL students in a class/form, sorted by their overall performance from best to worst. Unlike individual report cards (which show one student per page), this shows everyone on the same pages.
Think of it like a leaderboard in a sports competition - everyone can see where they rank compared to others.

2. HEADER SECTION (Top of Every Page)
Every page must repeat this header information:
School Information Block:

School name: "Friends Kikai Boys High School"
Exam title: "Form 3 - MID YEAR EXAM - (2025 Term 2)" (this changes based on which exam)
School address: "P.O BOX 345 CHWELE"
Phone: "0710702705"
Email: "kikaiboys@gmail.com"

Technical Requirements:

This header must appear at the top of every page when printed
If the report spans multiple pages (like this one does - 3 pages), the header repeats
The exam title appears twice - once as a subtitle and once as the main heading


3. THE MAIN TABLE (Student Data)
This is a massive table with many columns. Let me break down EVERY column:
Column 1: ADMNO (Admission Number)

This is the student's unique ID
Examples: 4473, 4323, 71, 44340
Can be 2 digits, 4 digits, or 5 digits
This is the primary identifier for each student

Column 2: NAME

Full student name
Examples: "Gospel Chemuku Walukana", "Cornelius Wekesa Mayam"
Can be 2 or 3 names
Display exactly as stored in database

Column 3: STR (Stream)

Shows which class stream: E (East) or W (West)
This is like different sections of the same grade
Students from both streams appear in the same merit list

Column 4: KCPE

Kenya Certificate of Primary Education score (entrance exam score)
This is what they scored when entering high school
Examples: 18, 200, 298, 285
Some students have this, many don't (leave blank if missing)
Maximum possible score: 500

Columns 5-26: SUBJECT SCORES (The Complex Part)
For each subject, you show TWO pieces of information:

The numeric score (raw marks)
The letter grade (A, B, C, D, E, or X)

Here's the subject sequence and how to display them:
English (ENG):

Shows: [Score] [Grade]
Example: "18 E" means 18 marks, grade E
Example: "34 D" means 34 marks, grade D

Kiswahili (KIS):

Example: "41 D+"

Mathematics (MAT):

Example: "9 E"

Biology (BIO):

Example: "50 C+"

Physics (PHY):

Only some students take this
If not taken: leave cell empty

Chemistry (CHE):

Example: "64 C+"

History and Government (HIS):

Only some students take this
Example: "78 B+"

Geography (GEO):

Only some students take this

C.R.E. (Christian Religious Education):

Example: "16 E"

Agriculture (AGR):

Only some students take this

Business Studies (BST):

Only some students take this

IMPORTANT PATTERN:
Each subject column shows: [numeric_score] [letter_grade]

Numeric score comes first
Space between them
Grade letter second
Grade can have + or - modifiers (like D+, C-, B+)

Column 27: SBJ (Number of Subjects)

Total count of subjects this student took
Example: "8" means they took 8 subjects
This is just a count, not a score

Column 28: TT MKS (Total Marks)

Sum of all subject scores
Example: "276" means 276 marks total across all subjects
This is the RAW total, not a percentage

Column 29: MN MKS (Mean Marks)

Average marks per subject
Calculated as: Total Marks ÷ Number of Subjects
Example: "39.43" for student with 276 total marks ÷ 7 subjects
Show to 2 decimal places

Column 30: GR (Overall Grade)

The average grade letter across all subjects
Examples: D+, D, D-, E, X
X means absent from most exams

Column 31: TT PTS (Total Points)

In Kenya, grades convert to points:

A = 12 points
A- = 11 points
B+ = 10 points
B = 9 points
B- = 8 points
C+ = 7 points
C = 6 points
C- = 5 points
D+ = 4 points
D = 3 points
D- = 2 points
E = 1 point
X (absent) = 0 points


Sum all subject grade points
Example: If student got D, D+, E, C, D, C+, B+, E = 3+4+1+6+3+7+10+1 = 35 points

Column 32: DEV (Deviation)

Shows how far above (+) or below (-) the class average
Example: "-13" means 13 marks below class average
Example: "+6" means 6 marks above class average
Can be positive, negative, or zero
Important: Some cells are empty (no deviation shown)

Column 33: STR POS (Stream Position)

Rank within their own stream (East or West)
Example: "1" means 1st in their stream
Example: "2/56" means 2nd out of 56 students in that stream
Format can be just the number or "rank/total"

Column 34: OVR POS (Overall Position)

Rank across ALL students in Form 3 (both streams combined)
Example: "1" means 1st overall
Example: "2" means 2nd overall
This is the MAIN ranking number

Column 35: VAP (Value Added Performance)

Shows improvement/decline from KCPE entrance score
Example: "-2.94" means performing below their KCPE potential
Example: "+5.23" would mean exceeding KCPE expectations
Most cells are empty - only shown for some students
This is optional data


4. SORTING/RANKING LOGIC
Critical requirement: The table MUST be sorted by performance, best to worst.
Primary sort: Total Marks (TT MKS) - highest to lowest
Secondary sort: If tied on marks, use Total Points (TT PTS)
Result:

Position 1 = highest scoring student
Position 87 = lowest scoring student (in this example)

Example from your data:

Gospel Chemuku Walukana - 276 marks (1st place)
Cornelius Wekesa Mayam - 245 marks (2nd place)
Mordecai Mayamba - 219 marks (3rd place)
...and so on down to position 87


5. THE "X" GRADE (ABSENT STUDENTS)
Many students at the bottom have "0 X" in multiple subjects.
What this means:

X = Absent from exam
They didn't take the test
Gets 0 marks and 0 points for that subject
Example: Student "Derrick Wekesa Wanjala" shows "0 X" in most subjects

Display rule:

Show "0 X" (zero space X) for absent subjects
Don't hide the X - it's important information
These students typically rank at the bottom (positions 48-87 in this example)


6. PAGE BREAK INDICATORS
Your document has 3 pages. Each page shows approximately 32-35 students.
Technical requirement:

Page 1: Students 1-32
Page 2: Students 33-64
Page 3: Students 65-87
Each page must have the header repeated
Footer can show "Page X of Y"


7. SUMMARY TABLES (Bottom of Report)
After all student data, there are THREE summary tables:
TABLE 1: GRADE BREAKDOWN BY STREAM
Shows how many students got each grade in each stream:
Columns:

FORM (which form/stream)
A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, E, X, Y (all possible grades)
ENTRIES (total number of students)
MEAN MARKS (average marks for that stream)
MEAN POINTS (average points for that stream)
GRADE (overall grade for that stream)

Rows:

"FORM 3 E" - statistics for East stream only
"FORM 3 W" - statistics for West stream only
"FORM 3" - combined statistics for all students

Example from your data:

FORM 3 E: 48 students, mean marks 13.8, grade D-
FORM 3 W: 39 students, mean marks 11.7, grade E
FORM 3 (combined): 87 students, mean marks 12.8, grade D-

Important detail: The grade columns show COUNT of students, not scores.

Example: "3" in the D+ column means 3 students got D+ overall

TABLE 2: CLASS GRADE SUMMARY (By Subject)
This shows performance in EACH INDIVIDUAL SUBJECT across all students.
Structure:

One row per subject
Same grade columns (A through X)
Shows how many students got each grade in that specific subject

Example for C.R.E. (Christian Religious Education):

1 student got B+
1 got B
1 got B-
1 got C+
3 got C
3 got C-
1 got D+
2 got D
18 got E
31 didn't take it (X or absent)
Mean marks: 29.1
Mean points: 2.7419
Overall grade: D

Subjects are listed from best-performing to worst-performing:

C.R.E. (best - mean 29.1, grade D)
Biology (mean 14.4, grade D-)
History and Government
Kiswahili
Agriculture
Geography
Physics
Mathematics
English
Chemistry (worst - mean 3.6, grade E)
Business Studies

TABLE 3: JUST BUSINESS STUDIES (Separate)
Business Studies appears alone at the bottom:

32 students didn't take it
Mean marks: 6.3
Grade: E

Why separate? Probably because very few students take it, so it's shown separately for clarity.

8. VISUAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS
Table Styling:

Borders on all cells
Alternating row colors (like Excel - light gray/white stripes) for readability
Header row: Dark background, white text, bold
Text alignment:

Student names: Left-aligned
Numbers: Right-aligned
Grades: Center-aligned
Stream (E/W): Center-aligned



Column Widths:

ADMNO: Narrow (60px)
NAME: Wide (200px) - longest column
STR: Very narrow (40px)
KCPE: Narrow (50px)
Each subject: Medium (80px)
SBJ: Narrow (40px)
TT MKS, MN MKS: Medium (70px)
GR: Narrow (40px)
TT PTS: Medium (60px)
DEV: Medium (60px)
Positions: Medium (70px each)
VAP: Medium (60px)

Font Requirements:

Font family: Arial or Helvetica
Header: 14pt bold
Table content: 10pt regular
Summary tables: 9pt

Page Layout:

Orientation: Landscape (because many columns)
Paper size: A4
Margins: Small (0.5 inch all sides)
If columns don't fit, reduce font size slightly rather than wrapping


9. EXPORT CAPABILITIES
Users need to be able to:

View on screen - HTML table format
Print - with proper page breaks and headers
Export to PDF - maintaining all formatting
Export to Excel/CSV - for further analysis


10. FILTERS/VIEWS NEEDED
The system should allow filtering the merit list by:

Form level - Form 1, 2, 3, or 4
Stream - Show only East, only West, or both combined
Exam/Term - Which exam period to display
Subject filter - Show only students who took specific subjects


11. DATABASE QUERIES YOU'LL NEED
To generate this report, your Django backend must:

Get all students for the selected form and exam
Get all exam scores for each student in each subject
Calculate for each student:

Total marks (sum of all subject scores)
Number of subjects taken
Mean marks (total ÷ subjects)
Total points (sum of grade points)
Overall grade (based on mean marks)


Sort students by total marks descending
Assign positions (1, 2, 3, etc.) based on sorted order
Calculate stream positions separately for East and West
Calculate deviations from class mean
Generate summary statistics for grade distribution
Generate subject-wise statistics for each subject


12. SPECIAL CASES TO HANDLE
Case 1: Students with no exams

Many students at bottom have 0 marks in all subjects
They still appear in the list (at the bottom)
Show "0 X" for all their subjects
Don't exclude them from the report

Case 2: Tied scores

If two students have exactly the same total marks
Give them the same position number
Example: Two students with 150 marks both get position 15
Next student gets position 17 (skipping 16)

Case 3: Different subject combinations

Student A takes 8 subjects
Student B takes 7 subjects
Both can be compared using mean marks (not total marks)
But primary sort is still total marks

Case 4: KCPE data missing

Most students don't have KCPE score
Leave that column blank (not "0" or "N/A")
Just empty cell

Case 5: VAP data missing

Most students don't have VAP value
Leave column blank
Only show when data exists


13. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS
This report can have 100+ students with 12+ subjects each.
Optimization strategies:

Use select_related() and prefetch_related() in Django
Calculate statistics once at query time, not per student
Cache the report for 5-10 minutes
Use pagination if viewing on screen (50 students per page)
Generate PDF asynchronously for large classes


14. PERMISSIONS/ACCESS CONTROL
Who should see this report?

School administrators - Yes, full access
Teachers - Yes, for their subjects/classes
Class teachers - Yes, for their class
Students - Debatable (can be sensitive showing everyone's ranks)
Parents - Usually NO (they see individual reports only)


15. GRADING SCALE REFERENCE
Make sure your system implements this exactly:
Marks to Grade conversion:

80-100 = A (12 points)
75-79 = A- (11 points)
70-74 = B+ (10 points)
65-69 = B (9 points)
60-64 = B- (8 points)
55-59 = C+ (7 points)
50-54 = C (6 points)
45-49 = C- (5 points)
40-44 = D+ (4 points)
35-39 = D (3 points)
30-34 = D- (2 points)
0-29 = E (1 point)
Absent = X (0 points)


16. KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR IMPLEMENTATION
Must-haves:

Sortable table by total marks
All 35 columns displayed correctly
Grade conversion working properly
Position calculation (stream and overall)
Summary tables at bottom
Header repeating on each page
Landscape orientation
Export to PDF and Excel

Nice-to-haves:

Click column headers to re-sort
Highlight top 3 students in green
Highlight bottom 10% in red
Search/filter by student name
Compare multiple exams side-by-side


This merit list is essentially a comprehensive leaderboard showing academic performance rankings with detailed subject breakdowns and statistical analysis. Every detail I've described must be implemented exactly as shown because schools use this format officially and parents/administrators expect it to look precisely this way.
