act like a pyhthon programmer with full knowledge in djago and help me solve this issue to my school still uses manual examination analysis where students do exam and after its maked the teachers enters the marks manual they calculate marks manually ranks and even comment manually but i have head of zeraki system in kenya that has the capability of doing so now i wanted to help them with the aoutomated website just like zeraki on exam analysis section but implement it with django framework and sqlite for testing lests just focus on examination part only the thing is students are in classes eg form 1 west ,Form2 East,form 3 south,Form 4 North so we have there own list in each class having name,admission number,Stream either east,west,south, north etc and KCPE marks then on results section is for each subject where we have maxmum maks set on top them studentresult form we have admno,name,marks and we should have a dashboard where we should select or desect subjects becouse not all classes does all subjects and not all students does all subjects just like the zeraki does we have teachers and every teacher has subjects he/she teaches and classes that he toughts so we have a super user,principle,deputy,Director of studies,teacher,then we should be able to generate pdf reports on a single page A4 size create dummy data for teachers superuser dos, etc assign teachers we are using sqlite and its for testing not in production already we have merit list for each class becoouse we are using chinesee techniuqe of studying i have some materials from the zeraki learn and build form them each teacher has his or her own dashboard and can be able to viev the progress performance of his/her own class professionally lets do this


I understand you want to build an automated examination analysis system similar to Zeraki for your school using Django and SQLite. Based on the documents you've provided, I can see the detailed structure of your school's data including class lists, exam results, and merit lists.

Let me search for any relevant integrations that might help with this project.

Now I'll create a comprehensive plan for your Django-based examination analysis system:
A Django-based examination analysis system similar to Zeraki for automated student performance tracking and reporting

I'll include the following features:

    Student management system with admission numbers, names, streams (East/West/North/South), and KCPE marks
    Class organization by forms (Form 1-4) with stream assignments and class teachers
    Subject management with maximum marks configuration per subject
    Exam results entry system for teachers to input student marks by subject
    Automated grade calculation and ranking within streams and overall positions
    Merit list generation showing student performance rankings with total marks and grades
    Teacher dashboard with subject and class assignments for performance monitoring
    User role management (Super User, Principal, Deputy, Director of Studies, Teachers)
    PDF report generation for individual student performance reports (A4 format)
    Subject selection dashboard to enable/disable subjects per class and student
    Basic performance analytics with grade distribution and class averages

I'll begin implementing the Django-based examination analysis system. Let me start by setting up the project structure and installing the necessary dependencies.

Now I'll create the Django project structure:

Let me check the directory structure and create the apps correctly:
Opened home directory

Great! Now I can see the correct structure. Let me create the Django apps:

Now I'll update the Django settings to include all the required apps and configurations:

Let me also add some additional configurations for the project:

Let me add the timezone setting and template configuration:

Now let me add media files configuration and custom user model settings:

Now I'll start implementing the database models. First, let me create the custom user model in the accounts app:

Now let me create the students app models:

Let me first read the existing models file and check for any LSP errors:
Checked code issues

I need to fix the LSP errors in the accounts model first:

Now let me write to the students models file:

Now let me create the exams models:

Let me create the reports models as well:

Now let me run migrations and set up the database:

Let me create the static directory and create a superuser, then register models in admin:

Let me configure the admin interface for all the models:

Let me configure the admin interfaces and set up the workflow:

Let me update the task status and configure the Django workflow:

Now I'll set up the Django workflow and create some sample data. First, let me configure the workflow:

Great! The Django server is running. Let me check the logs and create a superuser for the admin interface:
Checked system logs

Perfect! The Django server is running successfully. Now I'll create a management command to populate the database with sample data based on the provided documents. Let me create a superuser first:

Now I'll create a Django management command to populate the database with sample data:

Now I'll create the management command to populate the database with sample data from the provided school documents:

Now I'll run the management command to populate the database with sample data:

Excellent! The sample data has been populated successfully. Let me take a screenshot to see how the website is looking and then create some basic views for the examination system:

Great! The Django server is running and I can see the default Django page. Now let me create some basic views and templates for the examination system. First, let me create the URL configurations:

Let me create a basic dashboard and URL structure for the exam system:

Let me create the accounts URLs and then create the basic views:

Now let me create the basic views for the system:

Let me create the basic views and templates for the exam system:

Now I need to create the basic templates. Let me create the template directories and basic templates:

Let me create a base template and some basic templates to get the system working:

Let me create basic templates to get the system working properly:

Let me create a few more essential templates and then test the system:

Let me quickly create a basic login template and test the system:

Let me check the logs and then take a screenshot to see how the application is working:
Checked system logs

I can see there's an issue with the Django server reloading due to template path issues. The system is working but there are some errors. Let me call the architect tool to review the progress and provide guidance:

Perfect! The architect has provided excellent feedback. I can see the main issues that need to be resolved:

    Template loading issues - the Django server can't find the login template
    Missing core business logic for ranking and merit list calculations
    Need to add role-based permissions
    Missing several templates

Let me fix these critical issues one by one. First, let me fix the template loading issue and create a basic working system:

The login template exists. Let me check the Django server logs more carefully and try to access the site:

Let me check the latest logs and try to access the admin panel directly to test the system:
Checked system logs

Great! I can see the login page is now working (status 200). Let me take a screenshot of the admin panel and then complete the basic functionality:

Perfect! I can see that the Django server is running successfully and the admin panel is accessible. Now let me create the remaining essential templates and implement the merit list calculation functionality.

Let me create the missing templates and complete the core functionality:

Now let me create the ranking/merit list calculation functionality that the architect mentioned was missing. This is critical for the system to work properly:

Now let me create a management command to calculate the rankings and update the exam views to use the service:

Now let me run the ranking calculation and update the views to use the service:

Great! The ranking calculations have been completed successfully. Let me now take a screenshot of the system to see how it's working and then update the task status:

Excellent! The system is working! I can see the dashboard is loading properly with the statistics and navigation. Let me take another screenshot of the student list and merit list to demonstrate the full functionality:

Perfect! The system is working well. Now let me create a project documentation file and finalize the task:

Now let me update the final task status and get architect review:

The architect has provided excellent feedback. I can see there are three critical issues to fix:

    Merit list ordering: Not using the pre-computed positions correctly
    Template corruption: Need to fix the exam list template
    Auto-ranking integration: Results entry doesn't trigger ranking recalculation

Let me fix these issues quickly:

The exam list template looks fine. Let me fix the critical issues identified by the architect:

    Fix merit list ordering to use pre-computed positions
    Add auto-ranking recalculation to result entry
    Fix top performers ordering in exam detail

Perfect! I've fixed the critical issues identified by the architect. Now let me take a final screenshot to verify the system is working correctly and then get the final architect review:

Great! The system is working well. Let me check if there are any issues in the recent logs and then get final architect approval:
Checked system logs

Perfect! The Django server is running well and reloading properly after the changes. Now let me get the final architect review to confirm all critical issues have been resolved:

Excellent! The architect has confirmed that all critical issues have been resolved and the system now PASSES the review! 🎉

Let me update the final task status:
Optimized Agent memory

Perfect! 🎉

 i want you to study this instructions carefully becouse you are my programmer still on our system we want to advance this are my apps 'accounts',

    'students',

    'exams',

    'reports',

    'subjects', wich i have created and i have wired them and i want us to wire automatically so based on your experince you will tell me which files from which app do you need 
we are advancing the system 
the students are sorted groupwise in our system but now i want us to sort them now groupwise so one we shold have class_dashboard.html for the student of all forms like form2 students only
2. we should have stream_dashbord.html which has students from specific streams only like form2 but only students from west are available there alone not the student from north

on top of each dashboard we have mentioned we should have the cards for subjects availbale and if any exam is done the top students in each subject when you click on the subject card it should take you to the that particular subject information containing form for marks entry and also list of students name,admission number,marks for the very subject 
3. with the explanation above now we should have subject dashboard for the specific stream and subject dashboard for every form which will be like in form subject dashboard has all the stents in the very form like form2 students also you can use to enter marks 

now back to our class/stream dashboard on top we have cards but below it we have list of stdents having name,admin,kcse,marks in each subject listed horizontally with subjects name as labelled accordingly  totals avarage points,total marks,rank etc 

NB: the other dashboard for the very stream and forms are analysis dashboard wich contains all graphs visual performance of the classes top students  trend in performance and also the reportscan be generated also each student has his own dashboard so that we can be abel to trace perfomance and report ananlysis for the very student. the student can be able gto see the  well perfomed subject and graphs for the trends then pdf can be generated for each analysis and also the lists can be printed into sheet od paper A4 papers and we are not just converting the HTM tags to pdf we are looking for the3 specific information class list stricktly strudent information captured and also for exam result for specific subject or for the stream or form we should just export the table well vanished table titles and labels and thre data i  the table  not just scripting the html into a pdf not we are making a prophessionaly staff here


so when we enter astudent details like paul form2 west he goes to form2 dashboard that is general then he will be also found in a stream dashboard which is west

The exam dashboards as we have said here is the new scope of it one can downmload an excel free template and enters marks for students and upload back for anaylysis and  infact even students detals can be aploaded by csv or excel and then the data either for students or exam results can be exported either to word or excel also at subject level we should add same functionality you can add missing student in the subject or class where you will be able to search for the availability of the student i  the stream or form or even at school level 


4:Another crucial issue is here when a student has choosen 8 subjects but we are grading only 7 we should choose best perfomed 2 sciences eg if chemistry is 50%,Biology 79% and Physcs 10% we shoul exclude physiscs as we do avarage and also total marks the system does that automatically 

5: We should have entire shcool dashboard showing the top stream and form the top subject in the in each stream  form and also school the most imporoved subject graphs and other analysis features should be available 

6:department_dashbord.html which has the subjects for the very department and there analysis and it should be streamwise,formwise and schoolwise showing top subject in the department

7:Graduate student dashboard with this dashboard wich is available in each stream and ech form where we can click on a student of form3 west and we can move that student to form3 south or form form1 to form2 meaning we can move individual student or a group or a entire class 
NB this will be aplicable in a situation where a perticular student drops a subject and decides to do another subject on the way 

8: lets have a watermark with a school logo in everything meaning we show that the stend is is having valid pdf form a school 

9:the result list should be able  to sort the student in an order that is from the top student to the last one

10: subject champions dashboard having winners of the subjects in each stream and each form then comhbined entire school

11: we should have form subject dashboard having subjects details and  also we can demote those that are not done
12:we should have stream subject dashboard also having subjects to be done by the very stream and we can either select it or delesect meaning that if form2 west if we delect business and agriculture we will remain with students only doing the very subject or even we can just leave it becouse we have another dashboard specifically for students
13: students_subjects_dashboard where buy default everystent does each subject we can just either desect so that it wont  be availabe on the students report.

exam dashboard html for each stream and form so that when you click  on it in the classDashboard you can see the number of exams they have done listed on the dashboard then from there you can be able to view the resut for the particular exam then you can generate pdfs for all studentd which is in an A4 paper size 

you can also click on an individual student and click generate button for the result

main dahboard will be simple and prophesional have cards to go tospecific location eg analysis for the whole school,form,stream

it will be in variuos sections of cards where you click on forms it shpuld take you to forms eg 1,2,3,4 when you click on form4 you will see streams eg east,west,south,north  cards and also exams dashboard for form4 as whole the nwhen you click on exam dashboard you will see exams done by this students and you will be able to navigate into it back to  form you will see the studentsform combined stream of 4E,4S etc when you want to generate report you click on exam you have done so that you can view tha analysis of the very exam click analyze

Teachersacconts app section
every teacher will be allocated hist or here own subjects and classes right

after wich we will have roles set to everyTeacher 
and a class teacher can be able to view this whole class students results,
while just an normal teacher can only be able to view his or her ow class and subjects that he or she teachers ad its analysisis

so probably we should have class teachers dashboard  having the neccesary

for the marks upload a teacher of particular subhject just uploadsabd leaves the work for the class teacher to publish a subject teacher cant publish results the and the work for him is only to do
changes if and only if he or she has not published any results


templating we will have school having all gathered in formation from the school starting from teachers who teach particular subject, then cards for streams and forms like stream west form4

at the school that will be our control section having all junk in formations to direct us to various apps

when  subject will show as at school level how many subjects done all that junks should be done profesionally 

examination sections will also contain alll juk of exams staffs 


NB i also want a student to be able to logi using there schol code andd admission number to the system

And the professional thing is that i want this software to be used by several schools ad each school have its junk of staffs 
its a SAAs software 

so we should make a loading system which after loading tou will have a sectio  to select if you are teacher or student if student you will be asked to enter school code and admission number and he will be taken to his/her own school and and the big functionality he will be taken to his specific class and his his own dashboard where he can see his perfomance 

and if he chooses teacher  he willbe required to enter his/her own username eg email and password and he will be directed to his own school and his own classes like inyangala will be able to view form2,form3,form4 and specifically his or her own stream we can also extend his/her roles toteach the whole stream be couse we might lacke enough  teachers 

and the issue with grading i saw there is some mistakes like   here self.mean_points * (100 / grading_system.grading_rules['points'])
as you can see we have  12 points that the highest points we have and if we are grading oly seven perfomedsubjects  the total should be 84 points and this should not be head coded the system has to aware 

and on the issue of grade x ad y if you have been doing exam many math,eng,kiswa, and you were disqualified for a certain paper the three will just be added and the only bard thing is that you will have x,y grades

for someone who has not sat for that exam totally having x grades and marks his default grade wont be accountable while doing avarage of other learners becouse if we are competing they will pull mean down or that will reduce there mean 


and like a certain region of the school we are having a common exam we can have a sharing junks staff where they can be able to seethe schools that are availabliy doig exam and each teacher can acces a specific where he is registed andafter marks entry they can be able to analys this exams as a whole ranking best perfomers i each school that only where the scholl can be able to see the combined results of other school 

also lets have a fee maagement app where oe can be able to view his or her own shool fees availbe and it camn be able to be printed or included to there reports so all fee management logic should be availble and this now is only availbe or seen if the person who has logged in is the pricipal of the school or the accounts cleark or barsor so they are the only oes who can access the staffs of fee entry this other teachers can only be able to view the fee remaining or balanc how much has bee paid 

then o reportform  as we said just one A4 printable page will have 
top informationwhich is 
the first   column will have 2 rows
logo on  column1,column2 wil have school information eg  name,email,tell etc

second column has

then on grading  system we have two sections we have the gradig system per department or subject we we have already and we have gradig system for the whole school or for positionig the student
so like we collect the whole points in this subjects like the maxmum points in each subject we have 21 and but the sum of overrall points are 84 the system should be aware of that so the overall grade we are summing up all the grades in each subject then we convert them or refer them in our school grading system to get overall grade for the student 

i want you to study this instructions carefully becouse you are my programmer still on our system we want to advance this are my apps 'accounts',

    'students',

    'exams',

    'reports',
    school
    'subjects', wich i have created and i have wired them and i want us to wire automatically so based on your experince you will tell me which files from which app do you need 
we are advancing the system 
the students are sorted groupwise in our system but now i want us to sort them now groupwise so one we shold have class_dashboard.html for the student of all forms like form2 students only
2. we should have stream_dashbord.html which has students from specific streams only like form2 but only students from west are available there alone not the student from north

on top of each dashboard we have mentioned we should have the cards for subjects availbale and if any exam is done the top students in each subject when you click on the subject card it should take you to the that particular subject information containing form for marks entry and also list of students name,admission number,marks for the very subject 
3. with the explanation above now we should have subject dashboard for the specific stream and subject dashboard for every form which will be like in form subject dashboard has all the stents in the very form like form2 students also you can use to enter marks 

now back to our class/stream dashboard on top we have cards but below it we have list of stdents having name,admin,kcse,marks in each subject listed horizontally with subjects name as labelled accordingly  totals avarage points,total marks,rank etc 

NB: the other dashboard for the very stream and forms are analysis dashboard wich contains all graphs visual performance of the classes top students  trend in performance and also the reportscan be generated also each student has his own dashboard so that we can be abel to trace perfomance and report ananlysis for the very student. the student can be able gto see the  well perfomed subject and graphs for the trends then pdf can be generated for each analysis and also the lists can be printed into sheet od paper A4 papers and we are not just converting the HTM tags to pdf we are looking for the3 specific information class list stricktly strudent information captured and also for exam result for specific subject or for the stream or form we should just export the table well vanished table titles and labels and thre data i  the table  not just scripting the html into a pdf not we are making a prophessionaly staff here


so when we enter astudent details like paul form2 west he goes to form2 dashboard that is general then he will be also found in a stream dashboard which is west

The exam dashboards as we have said here is the new scope of it one can downmload an excel free template and enters marks for students and upload back for anaylysis and  infact even students detals can be aploaded by csv or excel and then the data either for students or exam results can be exported either to word or excel also at subject level we should add same functionality you can add missing student in the subject or class where you will be able to search for the availability of the student i  the stream or form or even at school level 


4:Another crucial issue is here when a student has choosen 8 subjects but we are grading only 7 we should choose best perfomed 2 sciences eg if chemistry is 50%,Biology 79% and Physcs 10% we shoul exclude physiscs as we do avarage and also total marks the system does that automatically 

5: We should have entire shcool dashboard showing the top stream and form the top subject in the in each stream  form and also school the most imporoved subject graphs and other analysis features should be available 

6:department_dashbord.html which has the subjects for the very department and there analysis and it should be streamwise,formwise and schoolwise showing top subject in the department

7:Graduate student dashboard with this dashboard wich is available in each stream and ech form where we can click on a student of form3 west and we can move that student to form3 south or form form1 to form2 meaning we can move individual student or a group or a entire class 
NB this will be aplicable in a situation where a perticular student drops a subject and decides to do another subject on the way 

8: lets have a watermark with a school logo in everything meaning we show that the stend is is having valid pdf form a school 

9:the result list should be able  to sort the student in an order that is from the top student to the last one

10: subject champions dashboard having winners of the subjects in each stream and each form then comhbined entire school

11: we should have form subject dashboard having subjects details and  also we can demote those that are not done
12:we should have stream subject dashboard also having subjects to be done by the very stream and we can either select it or delesect meaning that if form2 west if we delect business and agriculture we will remain with students only doing the very subject or even we can just leave it becouse we have another dashboard specifically for students
13: students_subjects_dashboard where buy default everystent does each subject we can just either desect so that it wont  be availabe on the students report.

exam dashboard html for each stream and form so that when you click  on it in the classDashboard you can see the number of exams they have done listed on the dashboard then from there you can be able to view the resut for the particular exam then you can generate pdfs for all studentd which is in an A4 paper size 

you can also click on an individual student and click generate button for the result

main dahboard will be simple and prophesional have cards to go tospecific location eg analysis for the whole school,form,stream

it will be in variuos sections of cards where you click on forms it shpuld take you to forms eg 1,2,3,4 when you click on form4 you will see streams eg east,west,south,north  cards and also exams dashboard for form4 as whole the nwhen you click on exam dashboard you will see exams done by this students and you will be able to navigate into it back to  form you will see the studentsform combined stream of 4E,4S etc when you want to generate report you click on exam you have done so that you can view tha analysis of the very exam click analyze
