Hey Kilocode, I need you to build a school management dashboard. Let me break it down step by step:

PROJECT: School Dashboard for Friends Kikai Boys High School
STEP 1: Create the Top Navigation Bar

Make a horizontal navigation bar with green background (#4CAF50)
On the left: Put the school logo and name "Friends Kikai Boys High School"
On the right: Add language selector showing "English", search icon, notification icon (with red badge showing "4"), and user profile picture with name "Paul Ijendi Inyangala"
